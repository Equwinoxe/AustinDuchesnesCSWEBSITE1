            <p>Kit is a <b>Legendary</b> Brawler who has a short range, low health and moderate damage output, but immense utility with his Super in his normal mode. In his alternate form, he has a long range and very high damage output. Kit's normal form attacks with a quick short-ranged claw with an extremely fast cooldown and reload speed.<br>
            </br>His Trait allows his Super to charge itself over time. For his Super, Kit quickly jumps a moderate distance. If he jumps on an enemy Brawler, he stuns and deals damage to them over time. If Kit jumps on an ally Brawler, he momentarily rides them, transforming into his alternate form and healing them over time in the process. </p>
            <p>Kit's alternate form attacks by throwing his ball of yarn over obstacles that blow up and deal high damage in a medium radius, while making him invulnerable. For his alternate form's Super, Kit jumps off the ally Brawler and transforms back into his normal form.<br> </br>His first Gadget, Cardboard Box, doubles his Trait's Super charge rate if he is standing still and makes him temporarily invisible to enemies.
            His second Gadget, Cheeseburger, heals him and his allies in his alternate form.<br> </br>His first Star Power, Power Hungry, increases the health and damage buffs from every Power Cube collected. His second Star Power, Overly Attached, increases Kit's alternate form duration.</p>
